## Problem

> LeetCode link: [Letter Combinations of a Phone Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/)

Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in any order.

A mapping of digits to letters (just like on telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: digits = ""
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: digits = "2"
Output: ["a","b","c"]
```

**Constraints:**
```
0 <= digits.length <= 4
digits[i] is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].

Note: Each digit maps to letters as shown on phone buttons:
2: "abc"
3: "def"
4: "ghi"
5: "jkl"
6: "mno"
7: "pqrs"
8: "tuv"
9: "wxyz"
```

## Solution

**Problem Simplified:**

Imagine you have an old-style phone keypad where each number button has several letters associated with it. Given a sequence of digits, your task is to generate all possible combinations of letters that could be formed by pressing these buttons. For example, if you press "23", where 2 corresponds to "abc" and 3 corresponds to "def", you need to output all possible combinations: "ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf". If no digits are provided, return an empty list.

**Edge Cases and Test Examples:**

*   **Empty Input:** `digits = ""`, Expected output: `[]`
*   **Single Digit:** `digits = "2"`, Expected output: `["a", "b", "c"]`
*   **Multiple Digits:** `digits = "23"`, Expected output: `["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"]`
*   **Input with Maximum Digits:** `digits = "79"`, Expected output: `["pw", "px", "py", "pz", "qw", "qx", "qy", "qz", "rw", "rx", "ry", "rz", "sw", "sx", "sy", "sz"]`

**Solution Analysis:**

| Approach | Advantages | Disadvantages | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Recursive Backtracking | Easy to understand and implement with clean code. | May have overhead from function calls (though not a concern for this problem's constraints). | O(4^n) | O(n) |
| Iterative | Avoids recursive function call overhead. | More complex implementation and harder to understand. | O(4^n) | O(4^n) |

*Complexity Analysis:*

*   Time Complexity: O(4^n) because each digit can map to at most 4 letters (as in 7 and 9), so for n digits, we have at most 4^n combinations.
*   Space Complexity: For recursive approach, O(n) for the call stack depth. For iterative approach, O(4^n) to store all combinations.

*Recommended Approach:*

I recommend using the recursive backtracking approach. It's more intuitive, has cleaner code, and is perfect for interview situations.

**Python Implementation:**

*Version 1: With Detailed Comments*

```python
class Solution:
    def letterCombinations(self, digits: str) -> list[str]:
        """
        Return all possible letter combinations that the phone number could represent.
        :param digits: Input string containing digits 2-9
        :return: List of all possible letter combinations
        """
        if not digits:  # Return empty list for empty input
            return []

        # Mapping of digits to letters
        digit_to_letters = {
            "2": "abc",
            "3": "def",
            "4": "ghi",
            "5": "jkl",
            "6": "mno",
            "7": "pqrs",
            "8": "tuv",
            "9": "wxyz",
        }

        result = []  # Store the final combinations

        def backtrack(combination, next_digits):
            """
            Recursive backtracking function to generate letter combinations
            :param combination: Current letter combination being built
            :param next_digits: Remaining digits to process
            :return: None
            """
            if not next_digits:  # Base case: no more digits to process
                result.append(combination)  # Add the complete combination to result
                return

            digit = next_digits[0]  # Get the first digit
            letters = digit_to_letters[digit]  # Get corresponding letters
            for letter in letters:  # Try each possible letter
                # Recursively build combinations with remaining digits
                backtrack(combination + letter, next_digits[1:])

        backtrack("", digits)  # Start with empty combination and all digits
        return result
```

*Version 2: Without Comments*

```python
class Solution:
    def letterCombinations(self, digits: str) -> list[str]:
        if not digits:
            return []

        digit_to_letters = {
            "2": "abc",
            "3": "def",
            "4": "ghi",
            "5": "jkl",
            "6": "mno",
            "7": "pqrs",
            "8": "tuv",
            "9": "wxyz",
        }

        result = []

        def backtrack(combination, next_digits):
            if not next_digits:
                result.append(combination)
                return

            digit = next_digits[0]
            letters = digit_to_letters[digit]
            for letter in letters:
                backtrack(combination + letter, next_digits[1:])

        backtrack("", digits)
        return result
```

**Detailed Walkthrough:**

Let's walk through the execution for input `digits = "23"`:

1.  `letterCombinations("23")` is called.
2.  Input is not empty, proceed with main logic.
3.  Initialize `result` as empty list `[]`.
4.  Call `backtrack("", "23")`.
5.  `next_digits` is not empty.
6.  `digit = "2"`, `letters = "abc"`.
7.  Loop through "abc":
    *   `letter = "a"`, call `backtrack("a", "3")`.
    *   `next_digits` not empty.
    *   `digit = "3"`, `letters = "def"`.
    *   Loop through "def":
        *   `letter = "d"`, call `backtrack("ad", "")`.
        *   `next_digits` empty, add "ad" to `result`.
        *   `letter = "e"`, call `backtrack("ae", "")`.
        *   `next_digits` empty, add "ae" to `result`.
        *   `letter = "f"`, call `backtrack("af", "")`.
        *   `next_digits` empty, add "af" to `result`.
    *   `letter = "b"`, similar process for "b".
    *   `letter = "c"`, similar process for "c".
8.  `backtrack` calls complete.
9.  Return `result` containing `["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"]`.
