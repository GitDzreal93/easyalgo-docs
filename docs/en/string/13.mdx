## Problem

> LeetCode link: [Roman to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/)

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, there are special cases. For instance, 4 isn't written as IIII, but as IV. The number 1 appears before 5 to make 4. Similarly, 9 is written as IX. There are six instances where this subtraction rule is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a Roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "IV"
Output: 4
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "IX"
Output: 9
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
```

**Example 5:**
```
Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90, IV = 4.
```

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= s.length <= 15
s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M')
s is guaranteed to be a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999]
All test cases provided follow the rules of Roman numerals.
Cases like IL and IM are not valid - 49 should be written as XLIX, and 999 should be written as CMXCIX.
For detailed rules about writing Roman numerals, you can refer to Roman Numerals - Mathematics.
```

## Solution

**Problem Simplified:**

Imagine you're playing an ancient number game where instead of using regular numbers (1, 2, 3...), you use Roman numerals (I, V, X, L, C, D, M). Each Roman numeral represents a specific value. The game's objective is to convert a Roman numeral into its corresponding integer value. There's a twist though - when a smaller value appears before a larger one, you subtract instead of add. For example, "IV" isn't 1+5=6, but rather 5-1=4.

**Edge Cases and Test Cases:**

* Empty string: "" (though problem states string won't be empty, consider for completeness)
* Single character: "I", "V", "X", "L", "C", "D", "M"
* Maximum value: "MMMCMXCIX" (3999)
* Minimum value: "I" (1)
* Special cases: "IV", "IX", "XL", "XC", "CD", "CM"

Test cases:

| Input (s)   | Output (integer) |
| :---------- | :-------------- |
| "III"      | 3              |
| "IV"       | 4              |
| "IX"       | 9              |
| "LVIII"    | 58             |
| "MCMXCIV"  | 1994           |
| "MCDLXXVI" | 1476           |

**Solution Analysis:**

| Approach        | Advantages                                                   | Disadvantages                                               | Time    | Space   |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :------ | :------ |
| Brute Force     | Straightforward and intuitive                                | Verbose code, needs to handle many cases                     | O(n)    | O(1)    |
| Lookup Table    | Fast and clean code                                          | Requires extra space for mapping table                       | O(n)    | O(1)    |
| Optimized Lookup (Recommended) | Combines lookup table with comparison rules, clean and easy to understand | None                                                        | O(n)    | O(1)    |

Complexity Analysis:

* Time Complexity: O(n) represents the need to traverse the string once.
* Space Complexity: O(1) indicates only constant extra space is needed.

**Recommended Solution: Optimized Lookup Method**

This approach is both easy to understand and implement during interviews. We use a dictionary (or hash map) to store the mapping between Roman numerals and integers. Then, we traverse the Roman numeral string from left to right. If the current value is less than the next value, we subtract it; otherwise, we add it.

**Python Implementation:**

Version 1 (with detailed comments):

```python
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        """
        Convert a Roman numeral string to an integer.

        Args:
            s: The Roman numeral string.

        Returns:
            The corresponding integer value.
        """

        # 1. Define mapping between Roman numerals and integers
        roman_map = {'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000}

        # 2. Initialize result
        result = 0
        
        # 3. Traverse the Roman numeral string
        for i in range(len(s)):
            # 4. Get current value
            current_value = roman_map[s[i]]
            
            # 5. Check if current value is less than next value
            if i + 1 < len(s) and current_value < roman_map[s[i + 1]]:
                # 6. If less, subtract current value
                result -= current_value
            else:
                # 7. Otherwise, add current value
                result += current_value
        
        # 8. Return result
        return result
```

Version 2 (without comments):

```python
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        roman_map = {'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000}
        result = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            current_value = roman_map[s[i]]
            if i + 1 < len(s) and current_value < roman_map[s[i + 1]]:
                result -= current_value
            else:
                result += current_value
        return result
```

**Code Execution Process:**

Let's walk through the code with input "MCMXCIV":

1. Initialize `result = 0`
2. Traverse the string "MCMXCIV":

   * `i = 0`, `s[i] = 'M'`, `current_value = 1000`. Since 'M' isn't the last character and `roman_map['M'] >= roman_map['C']`, `result = 0 + 1000 = 1000`
   * `i = 1`, `s[i] = 'C'`, `current_value = 100`. Since 'C' isn't the last character and `roman_map['C'] < roman_map['M']`, `result = 1000 - 100 = 900`
   * `i = 2`, `s[i] = 'M'`, `current_value = 1000`. Since 'M' isn't the last character and `roman_map['M'] >= roman_map['X']`, `result = 900 + 1000 = 1900`
   * `i = 3`, `s[i] = 'X'`, `current_value = 10`. Since 'X' isn't the last character and `roman_map['X'] < roman_map['C']`, `result = 1900 - 10 = 1890`
   * `i = 4`, `s[i] = 'C'`, `current_value = 100`. Since 'C' isn't the last character and `roman_map['C'] >= roman_map['I']`, `result = 1890 + 100 = 1990`
   * `i = 5`, `s[i] = 'I'`, `current_value = 1`. Since 'I' isn't the last character and `roman_map['I'] < roman_map['V']`, `result = 1990 - 1 = 1989`
   * `i = 6`, `s[i] = 'V'`, `current_value = 5`. Since 'V' is the last character, `result = 1989 + 5 = 1994`
3. Return `result = 1994`

I hope this explanation helps you understand the problem and its solution!
