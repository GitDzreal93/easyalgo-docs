## Problem

> LeetCode link: [Generate Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/)

Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 3
Output: ["((()))","(()())","(())()","()(())","()()()"]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 1
Output: ["()"]
```

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= n <= 8
```

## Solution

**Problem Simplified:**

Imagine you're working at a bracket factory, and your task is to generate all possible valid combinations of n pairs of parentheses. For example, if n = 3, you need to produce combinations like "((()))", "(()())", "(())()", "()(())", and "()()()". The challenge is to ensure that each combination is valid - meaning every opening bracket must have a matching closing bracket in the correct order. The input n is relatively small, ranging from 1 to 8.

**Edge Cases and Test Examples:**

*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   n = 1, Output: ["()"]
    *   n = 8, Maximum value, no need to worry about overflow
*   **Test Examples:**
    *   Input: n = 2
        Output: ["(())", "()()"]
    *   Input: n = 3
        Output: ["((()))", "(()())", "(())()", "()(())", "()()()"]

**Solution Analysis:**

| Approach | Advantages | Disadvantages | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Brute Force | Easy to understand | Inefficient, generates invalid combinations | O(2^(2n) * n) | O(2^(2n) * n) |
| Backtracking | Only generates valid combinations, efficient | Slightly more complex to understand | O(4^n / √n) | O(4^n / √n) |
| Dynamic Programming | Can solve it, but backtracking is more direct for generating all combinations | More complex state transitions | O(4^n / √n) | O(4^n / √n) |

*   **Complexity Analysis:**
    *   Time Complexity: Mainly considers the number of valid parentheses combinations, which follows the Catalan number pattern, approximately O(4^n / √n)
    *   Space Complexity: Storage needed for all valid combinations, matching the time complexity

**Recommended Approach:**

I recommend using the **Backtracking** approach. It efficiently generates only valid combinations, has a clear code structure, and is easy to understand and remember - making it perfect for interviews.

**Python Implementation:**

**Version 1: With Detailed Comments**

```python
class Solution:
    def generateParenthesis(self, n: int) -> list[str]:
        """
        Generate all valid combinations of parentheses

        Args:
            n: Number of pairs of parentheses

        Returns:
            List of all valid parentheses combinations
        """
        result = []  # Store the results

        def backtrack(s, left, right):
            """
            Backtracking function to generate combinations

            Args:
                s: Current parentheses string
                left: Remaining count of available opening brackets
                right: Remaining count of available closing brackets
            """
            # Base case: when no brackets left, add current string to result
            if left == 0 and right == 0:
                result.append(s)
                return

            # If we have remaining opening brackets, we can add one
            if left > 0:
                backtrack(s + "(", left - 1, right)

            # If we have more closing brackets than opening ones, we can add a closing bracket
            if right > left:
                backtrack(s + ")", left, right - 1)

        # Start backtracking with empty string
        backtrack("", n, n)
        return result
```

**Version 2: Clean Implementation**

```python
class Solution:
    def generateParenthesis(self, n: int) -> list[str]:
        result = []

        def backtrack(s, left, right):
            if left == 0 and right == 0:
                result.append(s)
                return

            if left > 0:
                backtrack(s + "(", left - 1, right)

            if right > left:
                backtrack(s + ")", left, right - 1)

        backtrack("", n, n)
        return result
```

**Code Execution Walkthrough:**

Let's walk through how the code works with n = 2:

1.  **Initialize:** `result = []`, `backtrack("", 2, 2)`
2.  **First backtrack:** `s = ""`, `left = 2`, `right = 2`
    *   Add opening bracket: `backtrack("(", 1, 2)`
3.  **Second backtrack:** `s = "("`, `left = 1`, `right = 2`
    *   Add opening bracket: `backtrack("((", 0, 2)`
4.  **Third backtrack:** `s = "(("`, `left = 0`, `right = 2`
    *   Add closing bracket: `backtrack("(()", 0, 1)`
5.  **Fourth backtrack:** `s = "(()"`, `left = 0`, `right = 1`
    *   Add closing bracket: `backtrack("(())", 0, 0)`
6.  **Fifth backtrack:** `s = "(())"`, `left = 0`, `right = 0`
    *   Base case reached, add "(())" to result
7.  **Back to third backtrack:** Try closing bracket, `backtrack("()", 1, 1)`
8.  **Fourth backtrack:** `s = "()"`, `left = 1`, `right = 1`
    *   Add opening bracket: `backtrack("()(", 0, 1)`
9.  **Fifth backtrack:** `s = "()("`, `left = 0`, `right = 1`
    *   Add closing bracket: `backtrack("()()", 0, 0)`
10. **Sixth backtrack:** `s = "()()"`, `left = 0`, `right = 0`
    *   Base case reached, add "()()" to result
11. **Final result:** `result = ["(())", "()()"]`

I hope this explanation helps you understand the solution!
