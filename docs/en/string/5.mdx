## Problem

> LeetCode link: [Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/)

Given a string `s`, find the longest palindromic substring in `s`.

A string is called a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```

**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consists only of digits and English letters
```
## Solution

**Problem Simplified:**

Imagine you have a string of characters, and you need to find the longest segment that reads the same forwards and backwards (a palindrome). For example, "aba" is a palindrome because it reads the same in both directions, while "abc" is not. Your task is to find the longest such palindrome within the given string.

**Edge Cases and Test Cases:**

* Empty string: `s = ""`, Result: `""`
* Single character: `s = "a"`, Result: `"a"`
* All same characters: `s = "aaaa"`, Result: `"aaaa"`
* General case: `s = "babad"`, Result: `"bab"` or `"aba"`
* Longer string: `s = "cbbd"`, Result: `"bb"`

**Solution Analysis:**

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| -------- | ---- | ---- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Brute Force | Simple and straightforward | Low efficiency, lots of repeated calculations | O(n³) | O(1) |
| Center Expansion | Efficient, clear logic | Need to handle odd and even length cases | O(n²) | O(1) |
| Dynamic Programming | Efficient, avoids repeated calculations | Requires extra space for state storage | O(n²) | O(n²) |
| Manacher's Algorithm | Most efficient, linear time complexity | Complex implementation, harder to understand | O(n) | O(n) |

* **Complexity Analysis:**
  * Time Complexity: Evaluates how execution time grows with input size. For example, O(n) indicates linear growth, O(n²) indicates quadratic growth.
  * Space Complexity: Evaluates how additional memory usage grows with input size.

* **Recommended Approach:**

  Center Expansion method. It's relatively easy to understand and implement, and efficient enough for interviews.

```python

    Args:
        s: Input string.

    Returns:

        Returns:

        """
        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:

        return right - left - 1  # Return palindrome length

    if not s:  # Edge case: empty string

**Version 2: Clean Code**

```python

    def expandAroundCenter(s, left, right):
        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:

        return right - left - 1

    if not s:

    start = 0
    max_len = 0

    for i in range(len(s)):

        if length > max_len:
            max_len = length
