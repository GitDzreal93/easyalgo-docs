## Problem

> LeetCode link: [Smallest K LCCI](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-k-lcci/)

Design an algorithm to find the k smallest numbers in an array. Return these numbers in any order.

**Example:**
```
Input: arr = [1,3,5,7,2,4,6,8], k = 4
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

**Constraints:**
```
0 <= len(arr) <= 100000
0 <= k <= min(100000, len(arr))
```

## Solution

**Problem Simplified:**

Imagine you have a pile of candies, and you want to find the k lightest ones. Similarly, this problem asks you to find the k smallest numbers from a list of numbers. The order of these numbers in your answer doesn't matter.

**Edge Cases and Test Examples:**

*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Empty array with `k = 0`
    *   `k = 0` for non-empty array
    *   `k = len(arr)`
    *   Array with duplicate numbers
*   **Test Cases:**
    *   `Input: arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8], k = 4`
    *   `Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]`
    *   `Input: arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8], k = 0`
    *   `Output: []`
    *   `Input: arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8], k = 8`
    *   `Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`
    *   `Input: arr = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6], k = 3`
    *   `Output: [1, 2, 5]`

**Solution Analysis:**

| Approach | Advantages | Disadvantages | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Sorting | Simple and straightforward | Inefficient when k is much smaller than n | O(n log n) | O(1) |
| Priority Queue (Heap) | Efficient for large datasets when k is small | Slightly more complex to implement | O(n log k) | O(k) |
| QuickSelect | Efficient on average | May degrade to O(nÂ²) in worst case | O(n) | O(1) |

*   **Complexity Analysis:**
    *   **Time Complexity:** Measures how the runtime grows with input size
    *   **Space Complexity:** Measures how memory usage grows with input size

*   **Recommended Approach:** Priority Queue (Heap)

    *   **Rationale:** Offers a good balance between ease of understanding/implementation and efficiency when k is small

**Python Implementation:**

**Version 1: With Detailed Comments**

```python
import heapq  # Import heapq module for heap implementation

def smallest_k(arr: list[int], k: int) -> list[int]:
    """
    Find the k smallest numbers in an array.

    Args:
        arr: Input array
        k: Number of smallest elements to find

    Returns:
        List containing the k smallest numbers
    """

    if k == 0:
        return []  # Return empty list if k is 0

    # Use max heap to maintain k smallest numbers
    # Heap size won't exceed k
    max_heap = []
    for num in arr:
        # If heap size is less than k, add element directly
        if len(max_heap) < k:
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -num)  # Store negative numbers to simulate max heap
        else:
            # If current number is smaller than heap top, replace heap top
            if -num > max_heap[0]:
                heapq.heapreplace(max_heap, -num)

    # Convert heap elements back to positive numbers and return
    return sorted([-x for x in max_heap])
```

**Version 2: Clean Implementation**

```python
import heapq

def smallest_k(arr: list[int], k: int) -> list[int]:
    if k == 0:
        return []

    max_heap = []
    for num in arr:
        if len(max_heap) < k:
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -num)
        else:
            if -num > max_heap[0]:
                heapq.heapreplace(max_heap, -num)

    return sorted([-x for x in max_heap])
```

**Step-by-Step Execution:**

Let's walk through the solution with input `arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8], k = 4`:

1.  **Initialize:** Create a max heap `max_heap` to store the k smallest numbers (we store their negatives since Python's `heapq` implements a min heap)
2.  **Process Array:** Iterate through each number `num` in `arr`:
    *   **Heap Not Full:** When `max_heap` has fewer than k elements, add `-num` to `max_heap`
    *   **Heap Full:** When `max_heap` has k elements, compare `-num` with the heap's top element
        *   If `-num` is greater than the top element, `num` is smaller than the largest number in our heap, so replace the top element with `-num`
3.  **Return Result:** After processing all numbers, `max_heap` contains the negatives of the k smallest numbers. Convert them back to positive numbers, sort them, and return the result.
