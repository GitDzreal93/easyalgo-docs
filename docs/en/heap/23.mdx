## Problem

> LeetCode link: [Merge k Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/)

You are given an array of `k` linked-lists `lists`, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
Merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: lists = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**
```
k == lists.length
0 <= k <= 10^4
0 <= lists[i].length <= 500
-10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4
lists[i] is sorted in ascending order
The sum of lists[i].length won't exceed 10^4
```

## Solution

**Problem Simplified:**

Imagine you have k decks of cards, each deck sorted from smallest to largest. Your task is to merge these k decks into a single deck, maintaining the ascending order. If all decks are empty, the result should be empty as well.

**Edge Cases and Test Examples:**

*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Empty input: `lists = []`
    *   Lists containing empty list: `[[], [1, 2, 3]]`
    *   Single list: `[[1, 2, 3]]`
    *   All empty lists: `[[], [], []]`
*   **Test Cases:**
    *   `Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]`
        `Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]`
    *   `Input: lists = []`
        `Output: []`
    *   `Input: lists = [[]]`
        `Output: []`
    *   `Input: lists = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]`
        `Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
    *   `Input: lists = [[5, 6], [1, 2], [3, 4]]`
        `Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`

**Solution Analysis:**

| Approach | Advantages | Disadvantages | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| One by One Merge | Simple implementation | Low efficiency, multiple traversals | O(kN) | O(1) |
| Divide and Conquer | High efficiency | Extra recursion stack space | O(N*logk) | O(logk) |
| Priority Queue | Intuitive and efficient | Extra heap space | O(N*logk) | O(k) |

*   **Complexity Analysis:**
    *   Time Complexity: k is the number of lists, N is the total number of nodes.
    *   Space Complexity: Considers recursion stack or heap space overhead.

*   **Recommended Approach:**

    Priority Queue (min-heap) is the most intuitive and efficient solution, ideal for interview scenarios.

**Python Implementation:**

*   **Version 1: Priority Queue (with detailed comments)**

```python
from typing import List, Optional
import heapq

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def mergeKLists(lists: List[Optional[ListNode]]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
    """
    Merge k sorted linked lists.

    Args:
        lists: List containing heads of k sorted linked lists.

    Returns:
        Head of the merged sorted linked list.
    """
    # Handle empty input
    if not lists:
        return None

    # Create a dummy node as the head of result list
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    current = dummy

    # Create a priority queue (min heap)
    # Each element is a tuple: (node value, list index)
    heap = []

    # Add first node of each list to the heap
    for i, head in enumerate(lists):
        if head:
            # Note: heapq sorts by first element of tuple
            # so we put node value as first element
            heapq.heappush(heap, (head.val, i))
            lists[i] = head.next

    # Keep taking smallest value from heap
    while heap:
        val, i = heapq.heappop(heap)
        # Add smallest value to result list
        current.next = ListNode(val)
        current = current.next

        # If the list we took from still has nodes, add next node to heap
        if lists[i]:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (lists[i].val, i))
            lists[i] = lists[i].next

    return dummy.next
```

*   **Version 2: Divide and Conquer (clean implementation)**

```python
from typing import List, Optional

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def mergeTwoLists(l1: Optional[ListNode], l2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    current = dummy
    
    while l1 and l2:
        if l1.val <= l2.val:
            current.next = l1
            l1 = l1.next
        else:
            current.next = l2
            l2 = l2.next
        current = current.next
    
    current.next = l1 if l1 else l2
    return dummy.next

def mergeKLists(lists: List[Optional[ListNode]]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
    if not lists:
        return None
    if len(lists) == 1:
        return lists[0]
    
    mid = len(lists) // 2
    left = mergeKLists(lists[:mid])
    right = mergeKLists(lists[mid:])
    return mergeTwoLists(left, right)
```

**Step-by-Step Execution:**

Let's walk through the priority queue solution with input `lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]`:

1.  Initialization:
    *   Create empty priority queue (min heap)
    *   Create dummy node, `current` points to dummy
2.  Add first nodes to heap:
    *   Heap contains: `[(1,0), (1,1), (2,2)]` (format: (value, list index))
3.  Process loop:
    *   First iteration: Remove `(1,0)`, add to result list, push `4` to heap
    *   Second iteration: Remove `(1,1)`, add to result list, push `3` to heap
    *   Third iteration: Remove `(2,2)`, add to result list, push `6` to heap
    *   And so on...
4.  Final return: `dummy.next`, giving us `[1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]`
