## Problem

> LeetCode link: [Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)

Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]
```

**Constraints:**
```
The number of nodes in the list is sz
1 <= sz <= 30
0 <= Node.val <= 100
1 <= n <= sz
```

Follow up: Could you do this in one pass?

## Solution

**Problem Simplified:**

Imagine you have a string of beads (linked list), and you want to remove the nth bead counting from the end. For example, if you have beads [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and n is 2, you want to remove the second-to-last bead (which is 4), resulting in [1, 2, 3, 5]. The problem gives you the start of the bead string (head) and n, and you need to return the start of the modified bead string.

**Edge Cases and Test Examples:**

*   **Empty List:** `head = [], n = 1` (Invalid input, per problem constraints list cannot be empty)
*   **Single Node:** `head = [1], n = 1` Output: `[]`
*   **Remove Head:** `head = [1, 2, 3], n = 3` Output: `[2, 3]`
*   **Remove Tail:** `head = [1, 2, 3], n = 1` Output: `[1, 2]`
*   **General Case:** `head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], n = 2` Output: `[1, 2, 3, 5]`

**Solution Analysis:**

| Approach | Advantages | Disadvantages | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| 1. Two Pass | Simple and straightforward | Requires two list traversals | O(L) | O(1) |
| 2. Fast-Slow Pointers (One Pass) | Only needs one traversal, efficient | Slightly more complex, requires understanding pointer relationships | O(L) | O(1) |

Where L is the length of the linked list.

*   **Time Complexity Analysis:** Traversing the linked list takes O(L) time, where L is the list length.
*   **Space Complexity Analysis:** All solutions use only constant extra space, thus O(1).

**Recommended Approach:** Fast-Slow Pointers (One Pass). It maintains time efficiency while requiring only one traversal, meeting the follow-up challenge, and uses minimal space.

**Python Implementation:**

**Version 1: With Detailed Comments**

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def removeNthFromEnd(head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
    """
    Remove the nth node from the end of the linked list

    Args:
        head: The head node of the linked list
        n: The nth node from the end to remove

    Returns:
        The head node of the modified linked list
    """

    # Create a dummy node pointing to head to handle head node removal
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    dummy.next = head

    # Initialize fast and slow pointers to dummy node
    slow = dummy
    fast = dummy

    # Move fast pointer n+1 steps ahead
    for _ in range(n + 1):
        # If fast reaches end, n is larger than list length
        if not fast:
            return head
        fast = fast.next

    # Move both pointers until fast reaches the end
    while fast:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next

    # Now slow points to the node before the one to be removed
    # Remove the target node
    slow.next = slow.next.next

    # Return the head of the modified list
    return dummy.next
```

**Version 2: Clean Implementation**

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def removeNthFromEnd(head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    dummy.next = head

    slow = dummy
    fast = dummy

    for _ in range(n + 1):
        if not fast:
            return head
        fast = fast.next

    while fast:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next

    slow.next = slow.next.next

    return dummy.next
```

**Step-by-Step Execution:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create a dummy node `dummy` with `dummy.next` pointing to the head node. Set both fast and slow pointers to `dummy`.
2.  **Advance Fast Pointer:** Move `fast` pointer `n + 1` steps forward. The extra step ensures that `slow` will point to the node *before* the one we want to remove.
3.  **Move Both Pointers:** Move both `fast` and `slow` pointers simultaneously until `fast` reaches the end (becomes `None`). At this point, `slow` points to the node just before the nth node from the end.
4.  **Remove Node:** Execute `slow.next = slow.next.next` to remove the target node.
5.  **Return Result:** Return `dummy.next` as the head of the modified list. Using `dummy.next` handles cases where the head node is removed.
