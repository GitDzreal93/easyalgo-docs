## Problem

> LeetCode link: [Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: l1 = [], l2 = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: l1 = [], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

**Constraints:**
```
The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50]
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
Both l1 and l2 are sorted in non-decreasing order

Note: The lists are singly-linked, meaning each node only points to the next node
```

## Solution

**Problem Simplified:**

Imagine you have two lines of students arranged by height, like two queues sorted from shortest to tallest. Your task is to merge these two lines into a single line, maintaining the height order. If one line is empty (empty list), you can simply use the other line as your result. The problem is essentially merging two sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.

**Edge Cases and Test Examples:**

*   **Empty Lists:** `l1 = [], l2 = []`, Expected output: `[]`
*   **One Empty List:** `l1 = [], l2 = [0]`, Expected output: `[0]`
*   **One Empty List:** `l1 = [1], l2 = []`, Expected output: `[1]`
*   **Normal Case:** `l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]`, Expected output: `[1,1,2,3,4,4]`
*   **All Elements in One List Smaller:** `l1 = [1,2,3], l2 = [4,5,6]`, Expected output: `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`
*   **All Elements in One List Larger:** `l1 = [4,5,6], l2 = [1,2,3]`, Expected output: `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`
*   **Including Negative Numbers:** `l1 = [-1,0,1], l2 = [-2,2]`, Expected output: `[-2,-1,0,1,2]`

**Solution Analysis:**

| Approach | Advantages | Disadvantages | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Recursive | Clean code, easy to understand | Potential stack overflow, slightly less efficient | O(m+n) | O(m+n) |
| Iterative | More efficient, avoids stack overflow | Slightly more complex code | O(m+n) | O(1) |
| In-place Modification | Lowest space complexity | Modifies original list structure, may not be suitable for all scenarios | O(m+n) | O(1) |

*   **Complexity Analysis:**
    *   Time Complexity: Based on how many times each node is visited. Both recursive and iterative approaches visit each node once, resulting in O(m+n) where m and n are the lengths of the lists.
    *   Space Complexity: Recursive approach uses O(m+n) stack space in worst case. Iterative approach uses O(1) as it only needs a few extra pointers.

**Recommended Approach:** Iterative

*   **Rationale:** The iterative method is more efficient, avoids potential stack overflow issues, and maintains O(1) space complexity, making it more controllable.

**Version 1: With Detailed Comments**

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        """
        Merge two sorted linked lists

        Args:
            list1: Head node of the first sorted list
            list2: Head node of the second sorted list

        Returns:
            Head node of the merged sorted list
        """

        # Create a dummy node to simplify merged list handling
        dummy = ListNode(-1)
        # tail pointer points to the last node of merged list
        tail = dummy

        # Loop through both lists until one is empty
        while list1 and list2:
            # If list1's current node value is less than or equal to list2's
            if list1.val <= list2.val:
                # Add list1's current node to merged list
                tail.next = list1
                # Move list1 pointer forward
                list1 = list1.next
            else:
                # Add list2's current node to merged list
                tail.next = list2
                # Move list2 pointer forward
                list2 = list2.next
            # Move tail pointer forward
            tail = tail.next

        # If list1 has remaining nodes, add them to merged list
        if list1:
            tail.next = list1
        # If list2 has remaining nodes, add them to merged list
        if list2:
            tail.next = list2

        # Return head of merged list (skip dummy node)
        return dummy.next
```

**Version 2: Clean Implementation**

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(-1)
        tail = dummy

        while list1 and list2:
            if list1.val <= list2.val:
                tail.next = list1
                list1 = list1.next
            else:
                tail.next = list2
                list2 = list2.next
            tail = tail.next

        if list1:
            tail.next = list1
        if list2:
            tail.next = list2

        return dummy.next
```

**Step-by-Step Execution:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create a dummy node `dummy` and a tail pointer `tail` pointing to `dummy` for building the merged list.
2.  **Compare and Merge:** While both `list1` and `list2` have nodes:
    *   Compare current nodes' values.
    *   Add the smaller value node to the merged list.
    *   Move the pointer of the list that contributed the node.
    *   Move the tail pointer to the newly added node.
3.  **Handle Remaining Nodes:** After one list is exhausted, append any remaining nodes from the other list.
4.  **Return Result:** Return `dummy.next` as the head of the merged list.
