## Problem

> LeetCode link: [Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:
1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "()"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= s.length <= 10^4
s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'
```

## Solution
**Problem Simplified:**

Imagine you're playing a matching game with brackets. Given a string like `()[]{}`, your task is to ensure all brackets are correctly paired up. It's similar to a card matching game where each opening bracket needs its matching closing bracket of the same type. For example, '(' pairs with ')', '[' pairs with ']', and '{' pairs with '}'. The tricky part is that the brackets must follow a strict order - just like Russian nesting dolls, where the last bracket you open must be the first one you close.

**Edge Cases and Test Cases:**

*   Empty string: `""`, Expected output: `true`
*   Single opening bracket: `"("`, Expected output: `false`
*   Single closing bracket: `")"`, Expected output: `false`
*   Single type of brackets: `"((()))"`, Expected output: `true`
*   Mixed brackets: `"(){}[]"`, Expected output: `true`
*   Wrong order: `"(]"`, Expected output: `false`
*   Incorrectly nested: `"([)]"`, Expected output: `false`
*   Long string: `"()".repeat(5000)`, Expected output: `true`

**Test Cases:**

| Input (s)    | Expected Output |
| :----------- | :-------------- |
| `""`         | `true`          |
| `"("`        | `false`         |
| `")"`        | `false`         |
| `"()"`       | `true`          |
| `"()[]{}"`   | `true`          |
| `"(]"`       | `false`         |
| `"([)]"`     | `false`         |
| `"{[]}"`     | `true`          |
| `"()".repeat(5000)` | `true`          |

**Solution Analysis:**

| Approach   | Pros                                  | Cons                                | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------- | :-------------- | :--------------- |
| Stack      | Easy to understand, clean code         | Requires extra stack space          | O(n)            | O(n)            |
| Replace    | Intuitive, straightforward            | Less efficient, multiple iterations | O(n^2)          | O(1)            |
| Recursion  | Clean code, follows natural intuition | Less efficient, risk of stack overflow | O(n^2)          | O(n)            |

*   **Complexity Analysis:**
    *   Time Complexity: Indicates how the execution time increases with input size. O(n) represents linear growth (doubles when input doubles), while O(n^2) shows quadratic growth (quadruples when input doubles).
    *   Space Complexity: Shows how memory usage scales with input size. O(n) means memory needs grow linearly with input, while O(1) indicates constant memory usage regardless of input size.

*   **Recommended Approach:** Stack. It offers the best balance between readability and efficiency.

**Version 1: With Detailed Comments**

```python
def isValid(s: str) -> bool:
    """
    Determines if a string of parentheses is valid.

    Args:
        s: A string containing only parentheses.

    Returns:
        True if the parentheses are valid, False otherwise.
    """
    # Initialize an empty stack to store opening brackets
    stack = []
    
    # Create a mapping of closing to opening brackets
    mapping = {")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "["}
    
    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for char in s:
        # If it's a closing bracket
        if char in mapping:
            # Pop the top element if stack isn't empty, else use dummy value "#"
            top_element = stack.pop() if stack else "#"
            # If the popped element doesn't match the current closing bracket, return False
            if mapping[char] != top_element:
                return False
        else:
            # If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
            stack.append(char)
    
    # Return True if stack is empty (all brackets matched)
    return not stack

# Code Execution Flow:
# 1. Initialize empty stack and bracket mapping dictionary.
# 2. Iterate through input string s.
# 3. For closing brackets, try to pop from stack.
#    - If stack empty, use "#" as placeholder.
#    - Check if popped element matches current closing bracket. If not, return False.
# 4. For opening brackets, push onto stack.
# 5. After iteration, return True if stack empty, False otherwise.
```

**Version 2: Clean Code**

```python

    stack = []
    mapping = {")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "["}
    for char in s:
        if char in mapping:
            top_element = stack.pop() if stack else "#"
            if mapping[char] != top_element:
                return False
        else:
