## Problem

> LeetCode link: [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, find two numbers in the array that add up to the target value and return their array indices.

You may assume that each input has exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1**:

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

**Example 2**:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 3**:
```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

**Constraints**:
```
2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Exactly one valid answer exists
```

Follow-up: Can you devise an algorithm with a time complexity better than O(n²)?

## Solution

**Problem Simplified:**

Imagine you have a deck of number cards and a target number. Your task is to find two cards that sum up to the target number. When you find them, you need to report their positions (indices) in the deck. Remember, you can't use the same card twice, and there's always exactly one valid pair.

**Edge Cases and Test Examples:**

*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Minimum array length is 2
    *   Numbers in the array and target value can be very large or very small

*   **Test Cases:**

    | Input (nums, target) | Output |
    |---|---|
    | `([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)` | `[0, 1]` |
    | `([3, 2, 4], 6)` | `[1, 2]` |
    | `([3, 3], 6)` | `[0, 1]` |
    | `([-1, -3, 5], 2)` | `[0, 2]` |
    | `([1, 5, -2, 8], 6)` | `[1, 2]` |

**Solution Analysis:**

| Approach | Advantages | Disadvantages | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Brute Force | Simple and straightforward | Inefficient | O(n²) | O(1) |
| Hash Table | Highly efficient | Requires extra space | O(n) | O(n) |

*   **Complexity Analysis:**
    *   Time Complexity: Measures how runtime grows with input size
    *   Space Complexity: Measures how memory usage grows with input size

*   **Recommended Approach:**

    Hash Table approach offers the best balance between time and space efficiency, and it's easy to explain and implement in interviews.

**Python Implementation:**

*   **Version 1: With Detailed Comments**

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    """
    Find two numbers in an array that add up to the target value.

    Args:
        nums: Array of integers
        target: Target sum value

    Returns:
        List containing indices of the two numbers, or None if not found
    """
    num_map = {}  # Hash table to store numbers and their indices

    for index, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num  # Calculate the required complement

        if complement in num_map:
            # If complement exists in hash table, we've found our pair
            return [num_map[complement], index]  # Return indices of both numbers

        num_map[num] = index  # Add current number and its index to hash table

    return None  # Return None if no solution is found

## Test Case
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
result = two_sum(nums, target)
print(result)  # Output: [0, 1]
```

*   **Version 2: Clean Implementation**

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    num_map = {}
    for index, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_map:
            return [num_map[complement], index]
        num_map[num] = index
    return None
```

**Step-by-Step Execution:**

Let's walk through the solution with input `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9`:

1.  Initialize empty hash table `num_map`
2.  Iterate through `nums` array:
    *   `num = 2, index = 0`:
        *   Calculate `complement = 9 - 2 = 7`
        *   `7` not in `num_map`
        *   Add `{2: 0}` to `num_map`
    *   `num = 7, index = 1`:
        *   Calculate `complement = 9 - 7 = 2`
        *   `2` found in `num_map`!
        *   Return `[num_map[2], 1]`, which is `[0, 1]`

Thus, we return `[0, 1]` as our solution.
