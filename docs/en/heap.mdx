Heaps are crucial data structures that frequently appear in algorithm interviews. Mastering heaps will give you a significant advantage when solving problems involving priority queues, Top K elements, and similar scenarios.

## 1. Basic Concepts

A heap is a specialized **tree-based data structure** that satisfies two key properties:

*   **Structural Property:** A heap must be a **complete binary tree** (all levels except possibly the last are completely filled, and nodes in the last level are filled from left to right). This ensures efficient array-based representation.
*   **Heap Property:** The value of any node must be consistently either greater than or equal to (or less than or equal to) the values of its children. This determines whether it's a max heap or min heap.

    *   **Max Heap:** Parent value >= Children's values (largest element at root)
    *   **Min Heap:** Parent value <= Children's values (smallest element at root)

**In simple terms:** A heap is a tree where either parents are always bigger than their children (max heap) or parents are always smaller than their children (min heap).

## 2. Characteristics

*   **Storage Structure:** Typically implemented using **arrays**. For an array index `i`:
    *   Parent index: `(i - 1) // 2` (integer division)
    *   Left child index: `2 * i + 1`
    *   Right child index: `2 * i + 2`
*   **Core Operations:**
    *   **Insert:** Add new element at the end, then bubble up (heapify up/sift up) to maintain heap property.
    *   **Remove Top:** Remove root element, move last element to root, then bubble down (heapify down/sift down) to maintain heap property.
    *   **Get Top:** Simply return the first array element.
*   **Key Property:** The root is always the maximum value in a max heap or the minimum value in a min heap.

## 3. Advantages

*   **Efficient Priority Queue Implementation:** Perfect for managing prioritized elements.
*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   Insert: O(log n)
    *   Remove Top: O(log n)
    *   Get Top: O(1)
*   **Space Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements.

## 4. Disadvantages

*   **Limited Access:** Only efficient for accessing the maximum/minimum element.
*   **Unstable Sorting:** Elements with equal values may change relative positions during heap operations.

## 5. Working with Heaps in Python

### 5.1 Using the heapq Module

Python's `heapq` module provides a built-in implementation of min heaps:

*   **`heapq.heapify(list)`:** Convert a list into a heap in-place.
*   **`heapq.heappush(heap, item)`:** Push an item onto the heap.
*   **`heapq.heappop(heap)`:** Pop and return the smallest item.
*   **`heapq.nlargest(n, iterable, key=None)`:** Get n largest elements.
*   **`heapq.nsmallest(n, iterable, key=None)`:** Get n smallest elements.

### 5.2 Custom Heap Implementation

Here's a custom implementation of a min heap to better understand how heaps work:

```python
class MinHeap:
    def __init__(self):
        self.heap = []
    
    def parent(self, i):
        return (i - 1) // 2
    
    def left_child(self, i):
        return 2 * i + 1
    
    def right_child(self, i):
        return 2 * i + 2
    
    def swap(self, i, j):
        self.heap[i], self.heap[j] = self.heap[j], self.heap[i]
    
    def sift_up(self, i):
        parent = self.parent(i)
        if i > 0 and self.heap[i] < self.heap[parent]:
            self.swap(i, parent)
            self.sift_up(parent)
    
    def sift_down(self, i):
        min_idx = i
        left = self.left_child(i)
        right = self.right_child(i)
        
        if left < len(self.heap) and self.heap[left] < self.heap[min_idx]:
            min_idx = left
        
        if right < len(self.heap) and self.heap[right] < self.heap[min_idx]:
            min_idx = right
        
        if min_idx != i:
            self.swap(i, min_idx)
            self.sift_down(min_idx)
    
    def push(self, val):
        self.heap.append(val)
        self.sift_up(len(self.heap) - 1)
    
    def pop(self):
        if not self.heap:
            return None
        
        if len(self.heap) == 1:
            return self.heap.pop()
        
        root = self.heap[0]
        self.heap[0] = self.heap.pop()
        self.sift_down(0)
        
        return root
    
    def peek(self):
        return self.heap[0] if self.heap else None
    
    def size(self):
        return len(self.heap)

# Usage Example
heap = MinHeap()

# Insert elements
for num in [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]:
    heap.push(num)

print(f"Heap size: {heap.size()}")  # Output: Heap size: 8
print(f"Top element: {heap.peek()}")  # Output: Top element: 1

# Pop all elements (in ascending order)
while heap.size() > 0:
    print(heap.pop(), end=' ')  # Output: 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 9
```

**Code Examples:**

```python
import heapq

# Create a list
nums = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]

# Convert list to min heap
heapq.heapify(nums)
print(f"Min heap: {nums}")  # Output: Min heap: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 4, 6]

# Insert an element
heapq.heappush(nums, 0)
print(f"After pushing 0: {nums}")  # Output: After pushing 0: [0, 1, 2, 1, 5, 9, 4, 6, 3]

# Remove smallest element
smallest = heapq.heappop(nums)
print(f"Popped smallest: {smallest}")  # Output: Popped smallest: 0
print(f"After popping: {nums}")  # Output: After popping: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 4, 6]

# Find 3 largest elements
largest_3 = heapq.nlargest(3, [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6])
print(f"3 largest elements: {largest_3}")  # Output: 3 largest elements: [9, 6, 5]

# Find 3 smallest elements
smallest_3 = heapq.nsmallest(3, [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6])
print(f"3 smallest elements: {smallest_3}")  # Output: 3 smallest elements: [1, 1, 2]
```

## 6. Common Problem Types

Heap problems typically fall into these categories:

*   **Top K Problems:** Finding K largest/smallest elements in a collection.
*   **Priority Queue Applications:** Task scheduling, event processing.
*   **Median Finding:** Maintaining the median of a data stream.
*   **Heap Sort:** While not the fastest sorting algorithm, it's an important concept.
*   **Merging K Sorted Lists:** Combining multiple sorted lists into one.

## 7. Problem-Solving Tips

*   **Understand Requirements:** First determine if you need a max heap or min heap.
*   **Choose Right Tools:** Use Python's `heapq` module when appropriate.
*   **Visualize:** Draw the heap's tree structure to understand operations better.
*   **Handle Edge Cases:** Consider empty arrays, K > array length, etc.
*   **Master `heapify`, `heappush`, `heappop` Usage.**

## 11. Memory Aid Poem

```
A heap's a tree that's quite unique,
Where parent-child relations speak.
Max heap or min heap, take your pick,
Top K problems it solves quick.

Array-based implementation clean,
Log N operations to intervene.
Practice well and you will see,
How powerful heaps can truly be!
